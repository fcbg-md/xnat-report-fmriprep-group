#       This section provides a brief overview of the key metrics and their significance in the context of the MRI analysis. Understanding these metrics is essential to interpret the overall quality and reliability of the results.
#     subtitle: Key Metrics Overview

# # Explanation for each metric in the "Basic confounds" section

    title: Visual report for Aliceloc task
- name: Basic confounds
  reportlets:
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: global, task: reward, extension: [.html]}
    caption: The average signal within the brain mask indicates the mean intensity value within the brain region and can be used to assess the overall signal quality.
    subtitle: Global signal
    - name: CSF
      - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: csf, extension: [.html]}
      caption: This metric represents the average signal within the anatomically-derived eroded cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) mask. A stable signal here can help ensure that CSF fluctuations aren't confounding the neural signals of interest.
      subtitle: CSF signal
      reportlets:
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: white, extension: [.html]}
    caption: The average signal within the anatomically-derived eroded white matter mask provides insights into the integrity and quality of white matter regions.

#     caption: The average signal calculated across the last axis (time).
#   - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: airmask}
#     caption: The <em>hat</em>-mask calculated internally by MRIQC. Some metrics will use this
#       mask, for instance, to find out artifacts and estimate the spread of gaussian noise
#       added to the signal. This mask leaves out the air around the face to avoid measuring
#       noise sourcing from the eyeballs and their movement.
#     subtitle: '&laquo;Hat&raquo;-mask'
#   - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: noisefit}
#     caption: The noise fit internally estimated by MRIQC to calculate the QI<sub>1</sub> index

#     caption: Brain tissue segmentation, as internally extracted by MRIQC.
#       Defects on this segmentation, as well as noisy tissue labels could
#       indicate problematic aspects of the image quality-wise.
